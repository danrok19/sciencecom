# App for my diploma thesis - frontend

An Internet application facilitating the organization of the science and education festival

## Quick summary

The goal was to create an internet application that would support the organization of 
a scientific and educational festival, as well as facilitate registration for it by those interested. 
The application provides organizers with functionalities such as adding individual events, creating party 
packages consisting of several events and the ability to modify them. In addition, the organizers decide 
on the participation of interested parties and can send e-mails in case of comments. From the 
participantsâ€™ side, the application allows to view added offers and book participation in them. 
When creating the application, technologies such as MongoDB were used as a database for storing 
data, Node.js and Express.js as a platform and framework for the application layer, and React.js to 
create the presentation layer. The UI is full responsive and can be used on mobile devices. :)
